<p>I'm in the process of researching and recommending a new Content Management System for my new employer and wanted to get anyone's take on the matter. We want to stay Open Source and need enough flexibility and scalability for future growth, while still being able to integrate with current IT systems. If you're had experience with either, weigh in below in the comments.</p>
