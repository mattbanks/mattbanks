<p>I'm looking for some help, friends. I've found numerous articles online for connecting an iPhone/iPod to multiple computers, but nothing I've found has really addressed what I'm trying to accomplish. So here the skinny...</p>
<p>My iPhone syncs to my MacBook Pro at home automatically when I plug it in. I do not want that to change. What I'm trying to accomplish is plugging my iPhone into my work PC and NOT having it sync automatically so I can listen to music/podcasts on my iPhone at work through my computer speakers. I want to retain the automatic syncing on my MacBook Pro at home.</p>
<p>The only thing I've found is turning off automatic syncing altogether for the device, which applies to all computers when you make that setting in iTunes. I also don't want to accidentally sync with my work computer and lose all my data during the day.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
