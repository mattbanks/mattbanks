<p>Hi there. I'm Matt. You probably knew that already. And you probably already read this part from the sidebar of the website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Web and iOS developer. I play with WordPress, Xcode, Backbone, Drupal, &amp; other fun stuff. Connoisseur of CSS, jQuery and video games. Yankees fan. Scotch lover.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a not-too-distant past, I was the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of <a href="http://loot-ninja.com" target="_blank">Loot Ninja</a>. Sadly, that project shut down as things in life got busier. I run <a href="http://www.kernelcreativemedia.com" target="_blank">Kernel Creative Media</a>, a web development firm specializing in WordPress, iOS, Drupal, and progressive HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript web technologies. If have an web projects in mind, head over that way and get in touch with us! I also work at <a href="http://sunyacc.edu">SUNY Adirondack</a> as a Web Developer and New Media Specialist where I developed and implemented Drupal for the college website, transitioned all data from a defunct content management system, and trained over 60 users to edit and create content for the college.</p>
<p>Well, what else can I say about myself. I moved to Saratoga Springs, NY in 2005, got married to my wife, Vanessa, in 2007, bought a house in 2008, had a son, AJ, in 2012, have 3 cats that terrorize my life on a daily basis, and am in year 5 of my 10 year plan for world domination. Almost there...</p>
