<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t's been a while! To say that I've been quite a bit lacking in blogging would be an understatement, considering it's been 4 years since the last post I wrote. I'm trying to fix that in 2018 with more personal experiences, things I enjoy, and some tech articles for web and software development. Let's kick it off with something I love: music.</p>

I listened to quite a bit of music in 2017. I use and pay for both [Spotify][mattspotify] and [Apple Music][mattapplemusic] (follow me on both!), going back and forth depending on what I want to listen to at any given moment. I've been sticking more with Apple Music lately, mostly because it sounds a lot better on my B&O H9 wireless headphones using the AAC codec (look for an in-depth bluetooth headphone review/breakdown coming soon). After analyzing everything I listened to in 2017, here's a breakdown of my favorites:

## My Top 5 Albums of 2017

1. Magic Giant - In the Wind
2. Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness - Zombies on Broadway
3. Bleachers - MTV Unplugged
4. Kendrick Lamar - DAMN
5. Circa Waves - Different Creatures

Magic Giant came out of nowhere this year and blew me away, both in studio and live shows! Their energy and positivity is contagious and a breath of fresh air. Andrew McMahon is a perennial favorite of mine and his latest is a terrific album. Bleachers have been growing me on over the past couple of years and their MTV Unplugged album is amazing! I'm a sucker for live music. And what can you say about Kendrick? He's a genius. Finally. Circa Waves came as a recommendation from my friend, [Yuliya][yuliya], and they did not disappoint!

While 2017 was a shitty year in many respects, musically we saw a lot of innovation, talent, and passion. 2018 is already shaping up to be as good, if not better. I plan on making my favorite music posts with a lot more regularly, and putting together some playlists to share. Keep an eye and an ear out!
