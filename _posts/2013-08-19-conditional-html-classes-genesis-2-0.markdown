<p>Have you upgraded to <a href="http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/">Genesis 2.0</a> and love the new HTML5 features, but want to target older Internet Explorer versions with classes like with <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>? Just drop this code into your child theme's functions.php file and you're off and running.</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/mattbanks/6269841</p>
<p>If you want to target IE7 or below, you can add those classes in as well (I'm only targeting IE8 here since I don't support IE7 and below).</p>
<p>This code is part of my <a href="https://github.com/mattbanks/Genesis-Starter-Child-Theme">base Genesis Child Theme on Github</a> as well.</p>
