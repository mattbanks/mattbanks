<p>I recently took on a part time position as the Web Developer for <a href="http://www.sunyacc.edu" target="_blank">SUNY Adirondack Community College</a>. In addition to some hardcore SEO, we'll be pimping out the site design and adding all kinds of new functionality to dramatically improve the user experience. Stay tuned for thoughts during the whole project.</p>
