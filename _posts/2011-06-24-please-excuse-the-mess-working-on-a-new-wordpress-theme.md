<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou may have noticed that the site looks quite a bit different... and rather bland. I'm in the process of totally revamping my personal site here with a new WordPress theme, so bear with me.</p>

It's been a rough day. If you didn't hear, [today we shut down Loot Ninja][lootninja-final], my now former video game news, editorial and review website. It's been my baby for almost six years, but it's time to say goodbye.

With [Loot Ninja][lootninja] gone, I'll be writing more here - something I've been meaning to do for quite a long time. Now I'll have time to write about things outside of video gaming (and some games too, for sure). Stay tuned!

And if you have any suggestions for things for this site, by all means let me know. I'm using WooThemes wonderful Canvas theme as the basis for my new WordPress theme. They have an amazing framework to build from, so this should be fun :)
