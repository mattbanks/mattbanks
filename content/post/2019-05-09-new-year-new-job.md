First I went 4 years between blog posts, and now we're at 15 months. I guess that's moving in the right direction...

I've had a lot of change in 2019 and I want to start blogging about all of the interesting things going on in my life. First off, I got a new job! I'm working at [Wolfjaw Studios][wolfjaw] creating web applications, back-end systems, and platforms for some of the best video game companies in the world. Prior to that (yeah, it's been a while), I was at [PUBG][pubg] and [MadGlory][madglory] doing similar types of work.

I've been working on some really cool tech lately too (more posts to come about some of it). I've worked with Angular, Vue, and React for front-end frameworks, built some cool Node and Go back-end systems, and got to work with GraphQL and fell in love with it.

On the personal front, my wife and I are expecting a baby girl this summer. It's both excited and terrifying at the same time. With our two boys, we know what to expect. I've also been exercising a lot more and lost 20 pounds. I'm looking to lose more and keep getting in better shape, so maybe I'll post some of that here too. We'll see how it goes.

Anyway, here's to hoping it's less than 15 months before the next post ðŸ˜Ž
