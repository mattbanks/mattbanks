title: Connecting iPhone to Multiple Computers - Need Help

I'm looking for some help, friends. I've found numerous articles online for connecting an iPhone/iPod to multiple computers, but nothing I've found has really addressed what I'm trying to accomplish. So here the skinny...

My iPhone syncs to my MacBook Pro at home automatically when I plug it in. I do not want that to change. What I'm trying to accomplish is plugging my iPhone into my work PC and NOT having it sync automatically so I can listen to music/podcasts on my iPhone at work through my computer speakers. I want to retain the automatic syncing on my MacBook Pro at home.

The only thing I've found is turning off automatic syncing altogether for the device, which applies to all computers when you make that setting in iTunes. I also don't want to accidentally sync with my work computer and lose all my data during the day.

Any ideas?
