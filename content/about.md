Hi there. I'm Matt. You probably knew that already. I live in Saratoga Springs, NY with my wife, our two sons, and soon a daughter.

> I'm a senior software engineer. I play with JavaScript, React, Redux, Vue, Angular, Node, Go, Python, Ruby, WordPress, and other fun stuff. I love video games. I'm a huge fan of Manchester City, the Yankees, and NYCFC. Pour over coffee and craft beer make me happy.

In a not-too-distant past, I was the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of [Loot Ninja][lootninja]. Sadly, that project shut down as things in life got busier.

I work at [Wolfjaw Studios][wolfjaw] creating web applications, back-end systems, and platforms for some of the best video game companies in the world. I previously worked at [PUBG][pubg] and [MadGlory][madglory] doing similar types of work.

I also run [Kernel Creative Media][kernel], a web design, development, and marketing firm. If have an cool projects in mind, head over that way and get in touch with us!
