	<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>i there. I'm Matt. You probably knew that already. I live in Saratoga Springs, NY with my wife, our two sons, and our two cats.</p>
    <blockquote><p>I'm a software enginner. I play with Node, Python, JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby, WordPress, and other fun stuff. I love video games. I'm a huge fan of Manchester City, Real Madrid, the Yankees, and NYCFC. Pour over coffee and craft beer make me happy.</p></blockquote>
    <p>In a not-too-distant past, I was the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of <a href="http://loot-ninja.com">Loot Ninja</a>. Sadly, that project shut down as things in life got busier.</p>
    <p>I work at <a href="http://madglory.com">MadGlory</a> creating back-end systems and platforms for some of the best video game companies in the world.</p>
    <p>I also run <a href="http://www.kernelcreativemedia.com">Kernel Creative Media</a>, a web design, development, and marketing firm. If have an cool projects in mind, head over that way and get in touch with us!</p>
